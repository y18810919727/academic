Biography
=========

Yuan Zhaolin is an Associate Professor at the School of Intelligence Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology Beijing. He was selected for the 2025 National Funded Postdoctoral Researchers Program. He received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Science and Technology Beijing in 2023. Following his doctoral studies, he conducted research at the Huawei 2012 Central Research Institute and the Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University. His primary research interests include intelligent mining, mineral processing, and metallurgy; intelligent manufacturing; intelligent control; large language model applications; and industrial system optimization. He has led the independent development of the "Paste Backfill Intelligent Control and 3D Visualization System" and the "Mineral Processing Section Decision Support System," which have generated cumulative economic benefits exceeding 40 million RMB for three domestic and international mining companies. He has published over 10 papers in top-tier artificial intelligence conferences such as AAAI and high-level international journals including IEEE TNNLS, IEEE TII, IEEE JAS, TUST, and Acta Automatica Sinica. Additionally, he has obtained more than ten patents and software copyrights. He has presided over four research projects, including grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China and enterprise-sponsored horizontal projects valued at over one million RMB each. His honors include the First Prize of the China Gold Association Science and Technology Award, the Second Prize of the China Institute of Electronics Science and Technology Progress Award, the University of Science and Technology Beijing Top Ten Academic Stars, the ACM-ICPC Asia Regional Gold Award, and a total of eight distinguished accolades.

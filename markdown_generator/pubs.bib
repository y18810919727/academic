  note={This paper investigates how Cyber-physical Internet (CPI) concepts can transform prefabricated construction logistics by introducing a protocol-based scheduling and routing framework designed to improve module shipment efficiency. Inspired by the logic of digital data transmission, the study draws parallels with internet communication principles to diagnose persistent challenges such as fragmented information sharing, limited coordination, and suboptimal routing decisions. To address these issues, the authors develop a suite of CPI protocols and propose a hierarchical, decentralized decision architecture governing logistics nodes. Numerical experiments and a real-world case study in the Greater Bay Area demonstrate enhanced efficiency, resilience, and collaboration, highlighting CPI’s potential to modernize complex construction logistics networks.}

  note={This study presents the Autonomous Jump Ordinary Differential Equation Net (AJ-ODENet), a continuous-time modeling framework designed for complex industrial systems exhibiting periodic jump dynamics. AJ-ODENet combines multiple Hierarchical ODENets to capture stage-specific behaviors from irregularly sampled data, while a stage transition predictor enables autonomous transitions during open-loop simulation. An encoder–decoder implementation of the model is applied to a real data center cooling system, using multivariate inputs such as server power and environmental temperature to simulate runtime behavior. Results show accurate prediction of energy consumption within a 5% relative error, and the model further informs optimal cooling temperature settings, enabling 6%–25% reduction in energy usage.}

  note={This study develops a deep-learning, continuous-time predictive framework for thickening systems, aiming to forecast critical outputs such as underflow concentration and mud pressure for optimal process control. The proposed model addresses challenges from non-linearities, long delays, partially observed data, and continuous-time dynamics by integrating a sequential encoder, a state decoder, and a derivative module to learn a deterministic state-space representation. Evaluated on a tailing thickener from FLSmidth equipped with extensive sensors, the model outperforms existing discrete-time approaches, effectively mitigating the impact of long delays and accurately predicting both short- and long-term system behavior.}

	abstract = {Cemented paste backfilling (CPB) has attracted worldwide attention because of its advantages in the processing of waste tailings and underground goafs. A problem of the underground CPB procedure that has received little attention is the shortage of devices or techniques for monitoring the real-time backfilling process accurately due to the harsh underground environment. Imprecise information of the backfilling progress will mislead the operators to make improper decisions, such as not pausing the transport system promptly or tuning the ratio of cement to tailings incorrectly. This study proposes a 3D visualization and soft-sensing system for the cemented paste backfilling process. By employing a GeoSLAM ZEB-HORIZON laser scanner to scan the 3D model of the underground goaf, the system estimates the backfilling height in real-time according to the accumulated volume of filled paste and simulates the backfilling of the underground goaf on web pages. In a real Copper Mine, we examined the developed system and soft-sensing technique in goafs and found that the relative error of estimated backfilling height is under 10%, which is acceptable in real production. The results indicate that the developed backfilling visualization and the soft-sensing techniques provide significant guidance for production management in underground backfilling.},

	abstract = {This paper focuses on the time series prediction problem for underflow concentration of deep cone thickener. It is commonly used in the industrial sedimentation process. In this paper, we introduce a dual attention neural network method to model both spatial and temporal features of the data collected from multiple sensors in the thickener to predict underflow concentration. The concentration is the key factor for future mining process. This model includes encoder and decoder. Their function is to capture spatial and temporal importance separately from input data, and output more accurate prediction. We also consider the domain knowledge in modeling process. Several supplementary constructed features are examined to enhance the final prediction accuracy in addition to the raw data from sensors. To test the feasibility and efficiency of this method, we select an industrial case based on Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). This Tailings Thickener is from FLSmidth with multiple sensors. The comparative results support this method has favorable prediction accuracy, which is more than 10% lower than other time series prediction models in some common error indices. We also try to interpret our method with additional ablation experiments for different features and attention mechanisms. By employing mean absolute error index to evaluate the models, experimental result reports that enhanced features and dual-attention modules reduce error of fitting ~5% and ~11%, respectively.},

	abstract = {The issue of missing values (MVs) has been found widely in real-world datasets and obstructed the use of many statistical or machine learning algorithms for data analytics due to their incompetence in processing incomplete datasets. Most of the current MVs filling methods are applied to the datasets with certain specific types or low missing rate. This paper proposes a method of missing values processing based on the combination of denoising autoencoder (DAE) and generative adversarial networks (GAN), aiming at the missing completely at random (MCAR) datasets with high missing rate and noise interference in industrial scenes. We execute the training process on a discrete dataset with missing values, in order to ensure the generated dataset is completely similar to the feature distribution of the original dataset. We conduct our experiments for different dimensional datasets to prove the feasibility and efficiency of this method, including three public authority datasets and an industrial production monitoring dataset. The results compared with traditional missing values imputation methods have shown when the missing rate is higher than 30%, our method performs better in robustness and accuracy.},

  note={This article proposes an offline-data-driven control strategy for paste thickening systems, addressing the challenges of high process complexity, partial observability, and environmental noise in mineral processing operations. By leveraging offline reinforcement learning, the approach eliminates the risks associated with unsafe online exploration while enabling data-efficient policy training. Operational trajectories are collected using a proportional–integral–derivative controller informed by domain knowledge, forming a reliable offline dataset. To handle constrained observation spaces, a novel algorithm—temporal batch-constrained Q-learning (TBCQ)—is developed for partially observed decision processes. Evaluations in both simulation and a real industrial paste thickener in a copper mine demonstrate improved control performance and significant tracking error reduction.}

note={This study develops a vision-based device for real-time monitoring of paste homogeneity during mixing processes. An image segmentation method is proposed to identify non-paste regions and detect areas of insufficient uniformity. To quantitatively assess mixing quality, a non-homogeneity factor is defined, providing an objective measure of paste uniformity. The relationship between blade position and paste homogeneity is further modeled using Gaussian process regression, offering insights into mixing dynamics. The effectiveness of the proposed metric is validated in a paste backfill station, where the results demonstrate strong consistency with engineers’ practical assessments.}

Leveraging conditional intensity predictions and attribution methods, the algorithm identifies root alarms and reconstructs anomaly transmission chains from cascading alarm events. Extensive evaluations on synthetic data and real-world datasets from the Huawei Shennong Intelligent Maintenance and Operation Center demonstrate NEC’s superior performance in alarm modeling and root cause identification.}

	abstract = {Cemented paste backfilling (CPB) has attracted worldwide attention because of its advantages in the processing of waste tailings and underground goafs. A problem of the underground CPB procedure that has received little attention is the shortage of devices or techniques for monitoring the real-time backfilling process accurately due to the harsh underground environment. Imprecise information of the backfilling progress will mislead the operators to make improper decisions, such as not pausing the transport system promptly or tuning the ratio of cement to tailings incorrectly. This study proposes a 3D visualization and soft-sensing system for the cemented paste backfilling process. By employing a GeoSLAM ZEB-HORIZON laser scanner to scan the 3D model of the underground goaf, the system estimates the backfilling height in real-time according to the accumulated volume of filled paste and simulates the backfilling of the underground goaf on web pages. In a real Copper Mine, we examined the developed system and soft-sensing technique in goafs and found that the relative error of estimated backfilling height is under 10%, which is acceptable in real production. The results indicate that the developed backfilling visualization and the soft-sensing techniques provide significant guidance for production management in underground backfilling.},

	abstract = {This paper focuses on the time series prediction problem for underflow concentration of deep cone thickener. It is commonly used in the industrial sedimentation process. In this paper, we introduce a dual attention neural network method to model both spatial and temporal features of the data collected from multiple sensors in the thickener to predict underflow concentration. The concentration is the key factor for future mining process. This model includes encoder and decoder. Their function is to capture spatial and temporal importance separately from input data, and output more accurate prediction. We also consider the domain knowledge in modeling process. Several supplementary constructed features are examined to enhance the final prediction accuracy in addition to the raw data from sensors. To test the feasibility and efficiency of this method, we select an industrial case based on Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). This Tailings Thickener is from FLSmidth with multiple sensors. The comparative results support this method has favorable prediction accuracy, which is more than 10% lower than other time series prediction models in some common error indices. We also try to interpret our method with additional ablation experiments for different features and attention mechanisms. By employing mean absolute error index to evaluate the models, experimental result reports that enhanced features and dual-attention modules reduce error of fitting ~5% and ~11%, respectively.},

@article{WANG201961,
	abstract = {The issue of missing values (MVs) has been found widely in real-world datasets and obstructed the use of many statistical or machine learning algorithms for data analytics due to their incompetence in processing incomplete datasets. Most of the current MVs filling methods are applied to the datasets with certain specific types or low missing rate. This paper proposes a method of missing values processing based on the combination of denoising autoencoder (DAE) and generative adversarial networks (GAN), aiming at the missing completely at random (MCAR) datasets with high missing rate and noise interference in industrial scenes. We execute the training process on a discrete dataset with missing values, in order to ensure the generated dataset is completely similar to the feature distribution of the original dataset. We conduct our experiments for different dimensional datasets to prove the feasibility and efficiency of this method, including three public authority datasets and an industrial production monitoring dataset. The results compared with traditional missing values imputation methods have shown when the missing rate is higher than 30%, our method performs better in robustness and accuracy.},
